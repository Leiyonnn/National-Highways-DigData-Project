The objective was to explore how different travel choices affect carborn footprint, recommending environmentally friendly options using real-world datasets

"Can you advise us how different travel choices can affect the carbon footprint? leverage diverse data sources to recommend best travel options to meet environmentally friendly travel options."

Using: Python, Jupyter Notebook,Excel, Libraries(Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Objective:
->With the excel sheet insdpected for inconsistencies, merging based on the study IDs to find out what makes the campaign successful
->Able to choose how to represent my findinsgs (I chose bar charts) to highlight winning patterns

The Python scipt:
->Merges and cleans campaign and study data while analysing success patterns across regions, aad types and verticals
->Uses bar charts to visualise key trends in advertiser effectiveness
This is to showcase my skills towards: Data merging and Data visualization (with Matplotlib and Seaborn)

The c_analysis.ipynb:
->Designed to show graphs and statistics from the excel sheet making it easier for viewers to interpret the results

DigDataStepUpSlides.odp is the powerpoint slide I used to present my findings
DigData Step Up.xlsx is the excel sheet that I had cleaned and used for the coding
